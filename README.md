# bellabeat_analysis
This is my capstone project for the Coursera Google Data Analytics course.  

This project uses all the skills that were taught during the course, including:  

- Ask Questions to Make Data-Driven Decisions
- Prepare Data for Exploration
- Process Data from Dirty to Clean
- Analyze Data to Answer Questions
- Data Analysis with R Programming
- Share Data Through the Art of Visualization

  I have included files for my cleaning process, analysis process, and overall presentation in the form of a PowerPoint.
